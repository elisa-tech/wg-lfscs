# LFSCS mission Statement
This working group aims to investigate Linux kernel features which may be leveraged for use in safety critical systems. We aim to bring together kernel developers and producers of safety critical systems to enable use of such features in real systems, and to learn from these experiences together as a community. This repository will contain the peer-reviewed materials produced by and for this group. Additional collaborative work-in-progress (topic suggestions, notes, etc.) in the project wiki.

## Planned activities
To identify existing Linux Kernel features which may be leveraged for use in safety critical systems.  For example, 
Mechanisms for protections of various memory types;  
Dynamic analysis for multi-threaded systems; 
Kernel profiling using ebpf-based tools; 
AER (Advanced Error Reporting) for fault handling;
Safety extensions to Linux drivers.
To bring together kernel developers and producers of safety critical systems to demonstrate use of such features in real systems, and to learn from these experiences together as a community.
To propose enhancements to such features and to work as a community to design / implement / deploy kernel patches.  Such patches should help to make those features more amenable for use in safety critical systems.
To work together with the other ELISA WGs so that those patches and features can be used by designers and integrators producing safety critical systems. 

## Collaboration
The WG strives to collaborate with existing working groups, primarily with the OSEP WG led by Paul, in order to provide supportive claims and evidences to help users of deploy LFSCS work products in safety-critical systems.

## Scope
The scope of this WG does not in any way include safety qualification or any safety claims on how the integrator can or should use these features or patches.  The only claims that would be made are a description of the feature and its functional impact.
