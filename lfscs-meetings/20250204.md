## Topics & Notes

## Meeting minute
* Review the work done on the document
   * Highlighted the presence of an alternative target executable in the 
     introduction. The aim is to have a larger executable that can trigger 
     a page fault.
   * Specified the use of Buildroot to create a minimal userspace. Since the 
     test is intended to be a userspace program executed from a prompt, having 
     a small userspace is essential. This addresses requests for clarification 
     on the complexity of the initialization phase.
   * Added a disclaimer to define the scope of the work. During a previous 
     meeting, there was an extensive discussion about the exercise's objectives. 
     It's important to note that features with dependencies do not require 
     exhaustive listing.
   * Proposed an initial conclusion for the document, although the conclusions 
     section is still incomplete.
   * Highlighted the need for data analysis to identify the minimal features 
     required for a basic program under these conditions.
   * Initiated a discussion on how features depend on kernel configuration.
   * Proposed a section in the document dedicated to this topic.
   * Demonstrated the tooling prepared for the investigation, which is part 
     of the KS-Nav suite. Watch the demonstration [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghUBAndh_uA).
