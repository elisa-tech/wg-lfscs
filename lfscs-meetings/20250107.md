## Meeting minute
1. Workshop Outcome Report
    * Background: The presentation of the workshop outcomes was delayed due to winter holidays.
    * Highlights:
        * Presentation from Nasa folks about linux for space
            * Requirements are produced and consumed by nasa
            * But they overlap with many other usecase, e.g. automotive.
            * My impression is that requirements for flying objects are stricter
        * Ks-nav presentation Amused the audience with another chapter of the ksnav saga.
            * A presentation from Luigi for a Basil usecase
        * Key Discussion:
            * Collaboration with kernel maintainers, particularly valuable for this WG.
            * Joint efforts with the Architecture Working Group discussed.
        * Outcome:
            * Steven Rostedt offered Ftrace (his maintained subsystem) as a starting point for kernel documentation.
            * It was informally agreed that the Linux Feature WG will:
                * Analyze the Ftrace code.
                * Initiate documentation efforts.
Next Steps: Begin work on documenting Ftrace as part of WG responsibilities.
2. Minimal Linux Features Document
    * Objective: Define the minimal Linux features required for a program that does nothing.
    * Progress Update:
        * Topic has been discussed in several past meetings.
        * A draft document has been created but is still under review.
        * Contributions during the winter break:
            * Boeing representatives provided input, resulting in unaddressed comments.
    * Outstanding Challenges:
        * Hidden Features:
            * These are features triggered by a program but executed via kernel threads (kthreads), not visible through the current methodology.
    * Initial Setup:
        * Suggested addition to explicitly include the setup process as a required feature.
    * Next Steps:
        * Address Boeingâ€™s comments on the draft.
        * Revisit the methodology to account for hidden features and the setup process.
