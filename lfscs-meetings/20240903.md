## Topics & Notes
* Review action items: `chacha_block_generic`
* Review action items: `CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU`
* Review action items: minimal configuration
* introduce new tool jount with Tool WG
* Continue discussion over the kernel essentials to
  run a bare minimal app.

## Meeting minute
* Alessandro presented a tool stemming from the Tool Working Group. Although 
  the tool is still incomplete, it provides an initial, albeit partial, 
  visualization of the Kconfig dependency graph.
* Discussion continued with the review of items from the previous meeting:
    * `chacha_block_generic`: The group discussed why this function is 
      included. Igor pointed out that the alignment function in the kernel
      uses randomization, likely due to kernel address randomization.
    * `CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU`: The reason for this configuration item being 
      enabled is that it comes from architecture defaults.
* The conversation shifted to the direction of the minimal configuration 
  we are working towards: 
    * Sebastian argued that minimal configuration should not depend on 
      specific use cases. Instead, the goal should be to identify a 
      common minimal set of Kconfig items that apply universally.
    * Igor raised a caution about certain items potentially depending 
      on the host build environment, which should be considered in the 
      configuration process.

## Action items
* repeat test removing all randomization related config items.
