    * None

* Planned agenda
    * Review TSC discussion about AoU [outcome](https://github.com/elisa-tech/tsc/wiki/24-Apr-2024)
        * LFSCS WG has yet to evaluate a feature as it lacks a system 
          definition to focus, highlighting the need for a clear understanding
          of AoU. 
        * While LFSCS may consume AoU externally, they may also develop them 
          internally, with a requirement to provide feedback.
        * Feedback is meant to be back-propagated using Basil.
        * Basil needs an architecture definition document, which will be one 
          of our outcomes in any feature analysis.
    * Start the discussion for the architecture document.
        * One document for all the features.
        * Different documents for each feature.
    * Define Safety Goals for the "kernel address space integrity"
        * Enumerate Kernel safety claims for this specific case
        * Which assumed Kernel safety requirements or AoUs can be defined to
          meet System Safety claims?
