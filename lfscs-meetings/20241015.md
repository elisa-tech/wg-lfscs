## Meeting minute
* **Report from TSC**: The topic of randomization in safety was presented to
  the TSC, which received feedback from members representing different WGs.
  The concern raised is that randomization could introduce variability
  (entropy) in program behavior, affecting test outcomes, especially if 
  safety relies on test results rather than formal verification. 
  TSC members generally did not oppose randomization, but believe it should
  only be used if there’s a strong rationale for its inclusion.
* **Aerospace WG Feedback**: The aerospace WG shared a message that does not
  explicitly state whether randomization is beneficial to safety.
  They referenced DO-178, which mandates that "only features necessary for
  achieving safety and security should be included in the software."
  They concluded that randomization should only be used if a Functional
  Hazard Assessment (FHA) identifies a specific hazard that requires it to 
  mitigate security risks.
* **Fundamental Concerns**: A primary concern with randomization and safety
  is that it may obscure faults, reducing confidence in test results.
* **Discussion on Testing**: The group discussed whether there could be tests
  that fail to detect issues. Yanmei emphasized that tests specifically
  designed to check variables will not miss problems.
  Alessandro pointed out that in Linux, test granularity is at the high-level
  functional level, not at the variable level. Therefore, if a bug does not
  compromise functionality with the current memory layout, it might remain
  undetected.
* **Configuration and Tuning**: The randomization discussion highlighted that
  some functionalities are controlled by sysfs variables, or "tuning"
  variables, which have safety implications.
  The LFSC WG had not previously considered tuning alongside kernel
  configuration as a source of change.
* **New Configuration Consideration**: The current "minimal configuration"
  epic aims to find a minimal configuration for a kernel to run.
  However, given the importance of sysfs variables, we might also need to
  consider a minimal set of tuning values (i.e., sysfs variable
  configurations).
* **Example from Alessandro**: Alessandro demonstrated the impact of tuning,
  using `arch_align_stack` as an example and explaining how
  `randomize_va_space` affects it.
* **Tracing and Minimal Features**: To track minimal program requirements,
  we’ve been using kernel tracing, though tracing isn’t a basic functionality
  and could influence our results.
  Despite careful design, tracing can interfere with observations.
  We may need to explore alternative approaches for observing kernel behavior.
* **Alternative Approach Using QEMU**: Instrumenting a QEMU instance could 
  allow a lighter kernel without the tracing subsystem.
  This approach, however, would require significant research, and it’s 
  uncertain if it would yield comparable results.
* **QEMU as a Debugging Tool**: The proposed method involves using QEMU as a
  GDB server to add breakpoints in the kernel code.
  This approach is complex, as GDB typically instruments only a subset of
  functions. Additionally, unlike within the kernel, the concept of the
  currently running PID is missing outside QEMU’s local logic, complicating
  things. However, the PID in the Linux kernel could still be traced via the
  `task_struct` in `current`, which is stored in the last portion of the stack.
* **Alessandro’s Prototype**: Alessandro demonstrated an early prototype based
  on this concept.
* **Gabriele’s Suggestion**: Gabriele proposed using ks-nav as an alternative.
  He suggested leveraging ks-nav to list all possible code paths and then
  using trace data to verify which paths were executed.


## Action items
