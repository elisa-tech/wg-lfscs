## Topics & Notes

## Meeting minute
1. Review Data
    * Analyze the collected data and identify key insights.
2. Examine ftrace Outputs
    * Identify relevant entry points:
        * SVC (Supervisor Call)
        * IRQ (Interrupt Request)
        * Aborts
    * Discussion points:
        * Several SVC calls are present, but only execve is required: all
          others are triggered by the calling code.
        * Clone syscall dilemma:
            * Should we include it in this investigation?
            * While the investigated code does not directly trigger it,
              execution depends on it.
        * IRQ path:
            * Confirmed not to be part of this investigation.
        * EL0_IA and EL0_DA paths:
            * Both are potential kernel entry points.
            * Justified by userspace’s lazy data page allocation, which
              relies on page faults to resolve missing allocations.
3. Identify Required Features by Subsystem
    * Excluding the parent clone syscall, determine the necessary features
      at the subsystem level.
      ```
      AIO
      ARM64 PORT (AARCH64 ARCHITECTURE)
      CAPABILITIES
      CHAR and MISC DRIVERS
      CPU HOTPLUG
      CRYPTO API
      EXEC & BINFMT API
      FILESYSTEMS (VFS and infrastructure)
      FUTEX SUBSYSTEM
      GENERIC INCLUDE/ASM HEADER FILES
      LOCKING PRIMITIVES
      MEMBARRIER SUPPORT
      MEMORY MANAGEMENT
      MMU GATHER AND TLB INVALIDATION
      PAGE CACHE
      PER-CPU MEMORY ALLOCATOR
      POSIX CLOCKS and TIMERS
      RANDOM NUMBER DRIVER
      READ-COPY UPDATE (RCU)
      SCHEDULER
      SECURITY SUBSYSTEM
      SLAB ALLOCATOR
      ```
      useful command:
      ```
for i in $(cat only____arm64_sys_execve.dot | grep " -> "| cut -d"\"" -f2,4| tr "\"" "\n" | sort|uniq); do \
		ssh dbs "psql kernel_bin -tAF, -c \"select '$i', subsys_name from tags where tag_file_ref_id in (select symbol_file_ref_id from symbols where symbol_name ='$i' and symbol_instance_id_ref = 56);\"" 2>/dev/null; \
	done | grep "AIO"
      ```
      investigated the source of subsystems


* action items
    * move the investigation [repo](https://github.com/alessandrocarminati/min_prog_trace) 
      in the Elisa namespace.
    * Integrate the investigation document with instructions on how to
      interpret the data.
    * Add instructions on how to use KSNav to integrate the data.
    * Convert the investigation google￼doc into markdown and add to the
      repository
    * The team agrees that the "clone" syscall-related features are not
      part of the minimal features, but a new paragraph explaining the
      reasons is needed.
