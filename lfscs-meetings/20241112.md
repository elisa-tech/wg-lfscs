* Daniel Weingaertner

## Topics & Notes
* Report TSC discussion about rnadomization
* Trace can be sometimes can be polluted by the instrumentation
  evaluate alternatives to ftrace.

## Meeting minute
* Initiating a review of the investigation document. First iteration of several.
* Exploring alternatives to ftrace for the investigation.
* Igor suggests hypothesizing the behavior we aim to analyze and then verifying 
  its accuracy, as this approach could help guide the instrumentation process.
* Igor notes that the PID-based strategy used so far might overlook certain features
  utilized by the application, such as cache management, which is typically performed
  asynchronously by kernel threads.
* The working group discusses the scope of the document. The discussion highlights the
  impossibility of conducting a completely exhaustive analysis, suggesting that the 
  document should explicitly outline its limitations.
* Defining what constitutes a minimal program.
* The working group deliberates on alternative methodologies for collecting information
  and concludes that ftrace is sufficient for the investigation. 

## Action items
* add contents to the document
