# Meeting 2025.04.01

## Hosts
* Alessandro Carminati

## Attendees
* Gabriele Paoloni
* Igor Stoppa 

## past action items:
* I left open the MR, I'd like Igor to add his comments before closing it
  Remember he suggested to add disclaimer about the fact that he wanted the 
  reader to be sure the inivestgation conditions.
  
## agenda
* Since last time some people missing, I want to quickly reiterate over the MR
  in anyone else has anything about the current form
* TSC has asked me to present the work done on the minimal feature.
* prepared a slides deck I want to share with you about this work
* about next topic the VMA

* Understand the mm_struct (defined in include/linux/mm_types.h).
* check mm_struct:
    * mmap (linked list of VMAs)
    * mmap_base (base address for mappings)
    * fields brk, start_stack, arg_start, arg_end, env_start, env_end
* check vm_area_struct
    * vm_start, vm_end (memory range of the VMA)
    * vm_flags (permissions: read, write, execute)
    * vm_ops (operations for the VMA)
    * vm_file (if the mapping is file-backed)
* VMA Creation Mechanisms
    * Study copy_mm() and mm_struct initialization during fork(), execve(), and clone().
    * Focus on do_mmap(), which is responsible for allocating a new VMA.
    * Study find_vma() and find_vma_intersection() for searching VMAs.
    * Learn how the kernel ensures non-overlapping mappings.
* Check architecture-specific layout details.


* System Calls that Create/Modify VMAs
	* mmap() (creates new mappings)
	* brk() (extends heap region)
	* mprotect() (changes protection flags)
	* mremap() (resizes/remaps an existing mapping)

* Memory Allocation Functions and VMA
	* kmalloc() or vmalloc() (slab allocator)
	* get_free_page()
* Page Table and MMU Involvement
* How the kernel updates page tables (pgd, pmd, pte) for VMA mappings.
* Role of handle_mm_fault() in populating page tables.
* Locking and Synchronization
        * How kernel synchronizes access to VMAs:
        * mmap_sem (now mmap_lock in recent kernels)
        * Read-Copy-Update (RCU) mechanisms.

* prevent kernel to drop pages either swap or just dropped because they are backed by a file <---
* memory layout? process vma + kernel vm  <---1
* memory structure presentation <---2
