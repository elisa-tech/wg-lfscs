# Meeting 2025.03.18

## Hosts
* Alessandro Carminati

## Attendees
* Gabriele Paoloni
* Igor Stoppa

## past action items:
* send a mail to the mailing list with a summary of the three PR
* remove the data files from min_ and move to the doc data.
* doc: add reference to the data used: expand the section of interpret data 
* after conclusion a note on where to find data.
reason why not include
  * the process invoking clone is another pid
  * process in examination is not using clone itself since it doesn't create any child.

## agenda
    * Discuss changes to the document.
    * Show additional paragraphs about excluding clone syscall
    * request people approval for merging stuffs.
    * ask about how to share the content with other groups.
    * start talking about next steps
        * as next topic I'd like to address the processes address space.
        * ceration, switching, distruction.
        * My suggestion is to  start with the clone syscall.
        * brain storm


## note
* Subsystem List Visibility
    * Some subsystems are known but do not appear in the list, even though the boot process completed successfully.
* Input from Igor
    * Igor claims that everything is functioning as expected.
* Disclaimer Suggestion
    * Add a disclaimer stating that the focus of this document is strictly on the specified subsystems.
    * Functional analysis of interference from other subsystems is out of scope for this document.
* Process Handling Suggestion
    * Suggest taking into account processes that do not terminate properly (this aspect is currently underconsidered).
    * Propose splitting process handling into three stages:
        * Creation
        * Usage / Context Switching
        * Destruction       
* VMA and Memory Handling
    * Set a minimum VMA (Virtual Memory Area) as a base for analysis.
    * Investigate Maple Tree usage and behavior.
    * Analyze the behavior of syscalls such as execve() and clone().
* Open Question
    * Should we limit the analysis to VMA structures, or also consider Maple Tree metadata?
