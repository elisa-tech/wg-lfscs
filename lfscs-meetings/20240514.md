# Meeting 2024.05.14

## Hosts
* Alessandro Carminati

## Attendees
* Igor Stoppa
* Gabriele Paoloni
* Christopher Temple
* Sebastian Hetze
* Daniel Weingaertner
* Florian Wuhr
* Mikel Azkarate

## Topics & Notes

* Past items
    * items from previous discussion:
        * toplevel: the kernel should guarantee memory integrity along the 
                    different phases of the kernel thread life cycle.
        * derivate: the kernel allocator mechanism should guarantee that 
                    when a new buffer is allocated the same is reserved for 
                    the driver/subsystem
        * derivate: Kernel needs to enforce variables scope
    * Alessandro: Prepare a list of claims to discuss next meeting link time.

* Planned agenda
    * Continue: Safe kernel address space integrity requirements.
    * Produce new items to add at the kernel claims list.
    
## Meeting minute
* Alessandro presents a summary of the prevous meeting using a couples of
  [slides](./resorces/20240514-LFSCS-Meeting.pdf).
* Alessandro initiates a conversation about the potential causes of kernel
   memory corruption, focusing mainly on the global data section.
* Alessandro and Igor discuss possible solutions to improve the kernel 
  memory detection mechanism.
* Igor warns about the implications of randomization.
* Alessandro proposes considering the padding present in structures and, 
  more generally, between variables.
* Data alignment for performance reasons often leaves some locations between
  data unused.
* These locations are not expected to change during execution, making them
  good candidates for detecting corruption.
* Alessandro suggests coloring (setting their value to a specific number) 
  to detect any changes.
* If this value changes, it indicates a software malfunction.
* Igor begins a conversation about how to achieve this and suggests that for 
  the data areas (.data, .rodata), this task can be assigned to the compiler.
* Alessandro agrees but notes that another solution is needed for the .bss 
  section and that a runtime solution is necessary for dynamically allocated 
  data.
